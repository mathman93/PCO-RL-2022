# PCO-RL-2022
The Matlab code and associated data for my research on optimizing the phase response function (PRF) for pulse-coupled oscillator (PCO) networks using reinforcement learning (RL) techniques.

The results of the research has been submitted to the Nature - Machine Intelligence journal (March, 2022).

Below is a brief description of the files available in this repository.
